## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- SASS
- HTML5
- Mocha / Chai (TDD)
- Webpack
- Fetch API

## Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

A hotel dashboard system allows customers to log in and plan their next stay. Users can log in and view their previous, upcoming and current stays at the hotel. The user is provided with insight into how much money they have spent and the number of nights they stayed at the hotel to date. Furthermore, users can search for rooms to book by date, and filter the results based the type of room. The fetch API is used to retrieve data on the user that logged in, and network requests are made throughtout the application to create and read data. 

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- If you would like to visit the website, [follow this link!](https://jalbe0076.github.io/overlook/)
- You may log in with a username between `customer01` through `customer50` and the password `overlook2021`

If you would like to run the app from your machine, follow these instructions:
1. Fork [this](https://github.com/jalbe0076/overlook) repository  
1. Clone down your new, forked repo using the command: `git clone git@github.com:jalbe0076/overlook.git`
1. Run the command: `cd overlook`
1. Run the command: `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run the command:  `npm start`
1. In your browser visit: `http://localhost:8080/`, you should see a login page
1. You may log in with a username between `customer01` through `customer50` and the password `overlook2021`

## Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

## Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

- Mod 2, Week 5: 
    - I am a current students of Turing School of Software & Design. 
    - Turing is a 7 month program, which offers a total of 4 modules. 
    - This project was completed during the fifth week of the second module that the program has to offer. 
    - A total of approximately 35 hours was spent on this project.

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests (using fetch API) to create and read data
- Implement a robust testing suite using Test Driven Development
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement the use of a project board and collaborate with other students to provide usability tests and code reviews.
